      Make software engineering collaborative and joyful again.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Developers write software within languages/frameworks, build tools, glue
      them together to (tool) chains, develop against APIs and communicate and
      collaborate with our colleagues. All of that should be efficient, joyful
      and secure.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      But it isn‚Äôt. Devs constantly struggle with larger codebases, cluttered
      dependencies, security policies and unnecessary friction in their
      workflows. We want to empower developers and empower them to code.

      Gitpod was founded because we were frustrated by manually setting up and
      maintaining dev environments.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are building Gitpod in the open to easily spin-up fresh dev
      environments for any task. Those ephemeral environments are fast &
      powerful, fully automated & initialized. They empower developers to
      immediately start coding, debugging, and testing their code.

      team.

Gitpod Dedicated is our new enterprise cloud product - a secure installation of Gitpod managed by us for you. Gitpod exists to remove friction from the developer experience, and the best way to do that is with a managed product in the cloud. We no longer actively support self hosting Gitpod.

## Prebuild Workspace Class

Prebuilds do a lot of work downloading dependencies, building projects, and getting everything ready so you are _Always ready to code_. Prebuilds often need more resources and power than the average workspace. Now you can configure different workspace classes for your project prebuilds. Check out your project settings for more details.

<!-- TODO: Documentation missing. Opened https://github.com/gitpod-io/website/issues/3334 -->

## Workspace Images OS update and breaking changes

Gitpod workspace images will be upgraded to use Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish).

- On March 6th, you'll be able to use the new images via the tag `TODO: insert tag here after merge to main`
- On March 13th, the images will be tagged as `latest`

If you'd like to continue using the current OS and Node versions, you may pin the workspace image version by changing the tag from `latest` to `2023-01-16-03-31-28` (e.g. `gitpod/workspace-node-lts:2023-01-16-03-31-28`) in your `.gitpod.yml` or `Dockerfile`.

As part of the update, there are some breaking changes:

1. [Deprecate `gitpod/workspace-ruby-2`; Ruby 2.7 is EOL March 31, 2023](https://endoflife.date/ruby).
2. Upgrade `gitpod/workspace-mongodb` to Mongo v6. v5 doesn't support OpenSSL 3, [OpenSSL 3 comes out of the box with Jammy](https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/jammy/openssl).
3. Update `gitpod/workspace-node-lts` and `gitpod/workspace-full` from Node 16 to Node 18
4. Update `gitpod/workspace-node` from Node 18 to Node 19
5. Install Python 3.9 in `gitpod/workspace-yugabytedb*`, changing its `base` ref from `full`. Refer to its [dockerfile](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/kylos101/jam/chunks/tool-yugabytedb/Dockerfile#L27) for context.

As well as some fixes and new features:

1. Bump Rust to 1.67.1
2. Bump Ruby patch versions for 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2
3. Override OpenSSL for Ruby 3.0 to support Jammy
4. Bump Ruby in `gitpod/workspace-full` from Ruby 3.1 to 3.2
5. Bump Python in `gitpod/workspace-full` from Python 3.8 to 3.11
6. Bump nvm version from 0.39.0 to 0.39.3
7. Use asdf version manager in `gitpod/workspace-elixir` to manage erlang and elixir

## Start new workspace with more options

Now you can start a new workspace with more options. You can choose the IDE, the workspace class, and any [context url](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url). ðŸŽ‰

## Improvements to reliability

Reliability improvements tend to go unnoticed. _No news is good news_. But we want to change that.

After countless improvements during the last months, our systems' reliability show significant improvements according to both our internal metrics and direct customer feedback. ðŸ˜Ž

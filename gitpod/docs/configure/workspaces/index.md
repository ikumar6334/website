# Workspaces

Gitpod is not simply "moving your laptop into the cloud". A key benefit of using a Cloud Development Environment ([CDE](/cde)) is _reproducibility_. When your workspace is configured, opening a new workspace is effortless—allowing you to fully embrace ephemeral development environments.

## Understanding Gitpod configuration

### The gitpod.yml file

The primary method of configuration is using a YAML file named `.gitpod.yml`, located at the root of your repository. The `gitpod.yml` file defines (for example):

1. The processes to start for your project - e.g. a database or webserver.
2. Required tools to install before the project starts.
3. Any editor extensions or IDE plugins to install.

See the [.gitpod.yml reference](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) page for more.

### A gitpod.yml example

```yaml
image: gitpod/workspace-full

# Commands that will run on workspace start
tasks:
  - name: Setup, Install & Build
    before: yarn global add express
    init: yarn install
    command: yarn build

# Ports to expose on workspace startup
ports:
  - port: 3000
    onOpen: open-preview
    name: Website
    description: Website Preview
```

**Caption:** An example project configured to install, build and run a `yarn` project with a webserver, exposed on port 3000. On start, the webserver preview is opened automatically.

### The workspace image

In addition to the `gitpod.yml` you can also specify a workspace image for:

1. Improved caching and performance
2. Application portability
3. Re-using an existing Dockerfile

Currently, Gitpod only supports Docker for workspace images. The Dockerfile can either be kept alongside your Gitpod configuration, or you can consume an existing public, or private image.

See [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) for more.

## Creating a Gitpod configuration

You can create a `.gitpod.yml` manually, or by using the `gp init` command (or `gp init -i` for interactive mode). The `gp` CLI tool is part of the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli), which is included in all Gitpod workspaces by default.

```sh
gp init
```

See the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) page for more.

## Validating your Gitpod configuration

You can test your configuration including your `.gitpod.yml` without leaving your worksapce or committing you changes by using the `gp rebuild` command. This command works using a [Debug Workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces/debug-workspaces), which you can think of as a mini workspace running in your workspace and allows you to troubleshoot workspace configuration (ports, tasks, etc) and more.

</figure>

You can use the `gp rebuild` command to test various configuration setups: simple workspace starts (without Prebuilds enabled), workspace starts using a Prebuild, or for debugging Prebuilds themselves. See below for the differences:

| Command                        | Steps ran                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `gp rebuild`                   | `before` + `init` + `command` |
| `gp rebuild --from="prebuild"` | `before` + `command`          |
| `gp rebuild --prebuild`        | `before` + `init`             |

> **Tip:** For improved speed and convienience whilst updating your workspace configuration, consider starting your worksapce using a large [Workspace Class](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes).

### Validating a workspace start (without Prebuilds configured)

To validate a regular workspace start:

1. Run `gp rebuild` to emit a Debug Workspace URL.
2. Open the Debug Workspace and review your configuration.
3. Update your configuration in the original workspace, and re-run `gp rebuild` (if needed).

### Validating a workspace start (with Prebuilds configured)

You can run `gp rebuild --from="prebuild"` to validate how a workspace start would look like when Prebuilds are enabled. If you don't have Prebuilds enabled, use the plain `gp rebuild` command.

1. Run `gp rebuild --from="prebuild"` - This command will emit a Debug Workspace URL.
2. Open the debug workspace to check your configuration.
3. Update configuration in the original workspace, re-running `gp rebuild` if needed.

> **Important:** This command runs the workspace _from_ a Prebuild not _as_ a prebuild. Meaning this produces the same environment that is created by a Prebuild process, before a workspace is subsequently started using it.

### Validating a Prebuild

You can run `gp rebuild --prebuild` to validate how a prebuild process would look upon completion (this runs `before` and `init` tasks, but not `command` tasks).

1. Run `gp rebuild --prebuild` - This command will emit a Debug Workspace URL.
2. Open the debug workspace to check your configuration.
3. Update configuration in the original workspace, re-running `gp rebuild` if needed.

> **Important:** This command runs the workspace _as_ a Prebuild not _from_ a prebuild. Meaning this produces the same environment that is created by a Prebuild process, before a workspace is subsequently started using it.

## Apply configuration changes

To apply your changes for all subsequent workspaces, commit and push the `gitpod.yml` (and `.gitpod.Dockerfile` if you created one) to the root of your repository.

Open the commit in a new workspace by either:

1. Prefixing your repo URL with `https://gitpod.io/#`
   - **For example:** https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nodejs/node)
2. Opening a new workspace from the [Gitpod dashboard](https://gitpod.io/dashboard)
3. Installing, and using the [Gitpod Browser Extension](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension#browser-extension)

> **Important:** You must commit the `.gitpod.yml` to the root of the repository and start a new workspace for changes to apply (a workspace restart is not sufficient).
